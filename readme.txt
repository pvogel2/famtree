Still experimental block to manage and visualize family trees (Scaffolded with Create Block tool).

== Description ==

The plugin provides the Pedigree Block showing configured family trees using threejs.

Multiple families are supported and can be configured on the pedigree options page.

One block instance can be configured to visualize one configured family, this can be switched on run time.

Kepp in mind that the plugin is still in beta and currently in development.

The block itself does not support access restricitons, this can be achieved by using one of the several avilailable WP plugins.

The plugin creates a dedicated role named 'pedigree' with custom capabilities to read and write stored family trees.
The administrator role also is extended with this capabilities.
